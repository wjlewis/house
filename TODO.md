## Designs

- [ ] Continue to rough out ideas on paper.
- [ ] Draw up promising designs in Blender.

## Skills

We should try to get some experience doing the following:

### Concrete/Masonry

- [ ] Pour a small corner of a footing. Dig down to undisturbed soil, build
      forms, set rebar, pour concrete.
- [ ] Lay a section of 8x8x16 stem wall on top of the footing.

### Framing

- [ ] Build a scale model to develop an understanding of framing "geometry".

### Roofing

- [ ] See if we can get a single section of standing seam roofing material; cut
      it into pieces and join them together.

### Finishing

- [ ] Build a small (e.g. 2x4ft) section of subfloor (including joists). Lay
      some hardwood floor; do the same with tile.
